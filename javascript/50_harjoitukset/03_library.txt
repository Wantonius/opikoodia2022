The Library

Library consists of two distinct REST APIs using the same database. Data will be about books 

{
	id:number, //(autogenerated)
	name:string,
	author:string,
	year:number,
	genre:string,
	loaned:boolean
}

First API will be for the Library Admin. This is a normal API like we did in the simple single page application:

GET /api/admin/books
	gets the list of all books
	
POST /api/admin/books
	adds a new book. Needs body.
	
DELETE /api/admin/books/:id
	removes a book from the collection
	
PUT /api/admin/books/:id	
	edits a book in the collection
	
The other API is for the clients. It has only three functions: show all books, show available books, loan/return a book:

GET /api/user/books
	get available books (loaned:false)

GET /api/user/all
	get all books regardless of loaned status
	
PUT /api/user/books/:id
	if the book is available change it to loaned and if loaned change it to available.
	
Test with Insomnia.

Bonus for people with energy: Create a frontend for this. Either do it normally (easier) or do it by the single page application philosophy (harder)
